Cymunk
======

Cymunk is a cython wrapper for [Chipmunk Physics](https://chipmunk-physics.net/)  
Some code is ported from [pymunk](https://github.com/viblo/pymunk) and much of the API is compatable  

Cymunk should be significantly faster than pymunk and run on android with [p4a](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android) - but it is less feature complete than pymunk and may not yet run on windows
